This requires approximation methods $q(\\theta) \\approx p(\\theta \\mid D)$ to be used [4].\n",

Incorporating a prior belief in investigating a posterior state is a central characteristic of Bayesian reasoning. This prior is hence often referred to as domain knowledge [5].\n",

The core idea is that $q(w)$ depends on some hyper-parameters that are then iteratively optimized by minimizing a divergenec measeure between $q(w)$ and $p(w \\mid D)$. Samples can then be efficientyl extracted from $q(w)$ [3]\n",

The method entails using dropout also at __test time__, which can be interpreted as performing Variational Inference (VI) with a Bernoulli variational distribution. The approximate predictive posterior is obtained by performing $M$ stochastic forward passes on the same input [4].\n",

However, since  $\\{\\hat{\\theta}^{(m)}\\}_{m=1}^{M}$, always can be seen as samples from some distribution $\\hat{q}(\\theta)$, we note that the previous equation is virtually identical to the equation described in MCD section. Ensembling can also be viewed as approximate Bayesian inference, where the level of approximation is determined by how well the implicit sampling distribution $\\hat{q}(\\theta)$ approximates the posterior $p(\\theta \\mid D)$ [4].\n"
